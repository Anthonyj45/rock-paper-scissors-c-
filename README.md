# rock-paper-scissors-c-
A simple program that will allow the user to play a funny game of Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

The idea of this program is to implement everything learned in C++, to develop an easy program
the user can play as many times as he/she wants Rock, Paper, and Scissors. 

To develop this program, starting from v0.5, where the main concepts will be implemented,
and the functions that are necessary to run the program are going to be developed, my idea
is to use Object Oriented Programming to classify and expand each Object that will be used.

The Objects will be the same that compose the game in the first place, this will help to keep
a constant and well-develop program that can be improved with time, adding some new
features and processes.

Giving some details about this game, Rock, Paper, Scissors is an old game that consists of 
these rules:

1.-Rock will always win against Scissors.
2.-Scissors will always win against Paper.
3.-Paper will always win against the Rock.

It is easy to develop a program that follows the same features using this simple method.
